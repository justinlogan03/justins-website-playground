        Sports today is all about championships. Often dubbed the “Count the
        rings” era, a player’s worth is often determined first and foremost by
        the number of rings they have. Whether it’s LeBron vs. Jordan or Brady
        vs. the field, it’s hard to argue with the athlete who has a fistful of
        rings.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        I don’t completely disagree with this mechanism. After all, sports is
        about winning, and winning championships is the ultimate achievement.
        However, when we focus solely on the rings, we risk overlooking some
        truly magical players. All-time legends like Jerry West and Peyton
        Manning have been criticized for not winning enough. Then there are the
        ringless stars like Karl Malone and Philip Rivers, who never seemed to
        reach their full potential. Of all these stars, one stands alone as the
        greatest to never win a ring: Dan Marino.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        I’m here to argue that, despite never winning a ring, Dan Marino
        deserves a spot on the shortlist of the greatest quarterbacks of all
        time. His body of work is remarkable, but the greatest talking point is
        his 1984 MVP season. Brady has 7 rings, Mahomes just keeps on winning,
        but no quarterback will ever have a season like Marino did in 1984.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        Marino’s season should be remembered for how much of an anomaly it was.
        Over time, the NFL has evolved into a passing league, and this is
        reflected in all major passing stats. Marino’s season is special because
        of how much of a leap it represented. The passing records prior to 1984
        were 36 touchdowns (a tie between George Blanda in 1961 and Y.A. Tittle
        in 1963) and 4,802 yards (set by Dan Fouts in 1981). To truly appreciate
        how special Marino’s season was, let’s compare his stats to those of the
        previous leaders and see what they would look like today.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        Just in raw numbers, Marino broke the touchdown and yardage records by
        12 touchdowns and 282 yards. If you add these numbers to the records
        currently held by Manning, you would get a season with an astounding 67
        touchdowns and 5,759 yards. But that’s not the whole story. A more
        fitting analysis would investigate the percentage increase from record
        to record. When measuring percentages, we have to take into account that
        Blanda and Tittle played their seasons in a 14-game regular season,
        while Marino, Fouts, and Manning set their records in 16 games, and
        today’s league plays 17.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        Breaking the records down into per-game numbers, Marino took the record
        from 2.57 touchdowns and 300 yards per game to 3 touchdowns and 318
        yards per game. This is an increase of 16.7% and 6%, respectively.
        Manning’s 2013 season accounted for 3.44 touchdowns and 342 yards per
        game. If you were to increase Manning’s record by the same percentages
        (accounting for today’s 17-game regular season), you would get an
        unimaginable season of 68 touchdowns and 6,154 yards.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        Let me summarize what we just found. Dan Marino’s 1984 season was such
        an outlier that he didn’t just break the records; he obliterated them.
        His stunning season would be comparable to a quarterback throwing 68
        touchdowns and 6,154 yards in 2026, with those records holding until
        2046 and 2050.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white">
        Now, what does all of this mean? I’m not arguing that Marino should be
        ahead of legends like Tom Brady or Joe Montana in the quarterback
        hierarchy. What I am saying is that Dan Marino had the single best
        quarterback season this league has ever seen—and by a significant
        margin. In 1984, he played at a level never before seen, and likely
        never to be seen again. To say Marino’s peak was higher than any
        quarterback’s ever would not be too far of a leap—and that has to count
        for something.
